## Description: 📝
This dataset contains 4440 measurements of compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, electrical resistivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity on concrete samples. The data corresponds to 12 different concrete mixtures, each containing a variety of resistance, aggregates, and additives.

## Project summary, description or abstract: 📚

The primary purpose of this dataset is to provide a benchmark for machine learning models and to facilitate research in the field of concrete strength prediction. The data can be used to train and evaluate models, as well as for comparison with other datasets.

# The dataset includes the following columns:

Compressive strength (MPa)

Tensile strength (MPa)
Flexural strength (MPa)
Electrical resistivity (kΩ·cm)
Ultrasonic pulse velocity (km/s)
Each row represents a single sample, with the strengths and resistivity measurements taken at 28 days after casting.
